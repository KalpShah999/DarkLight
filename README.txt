DarkLight 

This game was indie developed over the course of 1.5 years by a small 3-person team I had assembled. 

I (Kalp Shah) worked on the game mechanics and programming. I used Unity and C# to create the front and back ends of the game. 
Harigovind Kuruvelil worked on the audio design within the game using FL Studios and Wwise.
Bhagya Kumar worked on the visual graphics, game objects and textures, using Blender.
